## Detecting Twitter Bots in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic (continued)

My work in the first iteration of this project (i.e., "capstone_samuel_park_notebook1.ipynb" and "capstone_samuel_park_notebook2.ipynb") had much room for improvements due to how hastily the project was put together. 

I am going to use the same datasets from Shane Smith but start from scratch to incorporate more advanced and practical tools. Another reason for a new beginning is to showcase better practices when it comes to communicating my thought processes and results. 


I will be using tools and methods that were not incorporated in the first iteration, such as:

- Amazon Web Services for storage and computing
- NLP-oriented ML models
- sentiment analysis

### Objective 

The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to detect COVID-related Twitter bots in 2020. A second tentative objective is to discern harmful bots among the pool of bots that the model(s) find. 

The nature of this project is still much rooted in self-studying, and intellectual exploration/challenge.
